        This project considers the uncertainty of human actions and their implications on the environment and safety of our planet. It is connected to the NHV themes of professional ethics and engineering, as well as environmental ethics. The "doom" implied by the countdown is meant to instill a sense of responsibility in engineers and scientists in considering the full impact their creation may have on society. Also, by simulating a doomsday countdown, my project emphasizes the need for ethical considerations in environmental stewardship and conservation.
